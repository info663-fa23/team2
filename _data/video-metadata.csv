With three chairs as its only props, little speech, some song and much meaningful movement and expressive acting, the piece shows longtime cohabitants engaged in a contest for space.

They sit on the porch, watch the horizon, and wait for the weather to change. Their only hope is an audience.

This type of nutrition leads to high numbers of Hispanic/Latino having diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

The setting is a café where people come to spend a few hours so that the ‘deep bitter knowing that their life is not worth much can be laid to rest.’ Racial, gender and regional stereotypes come together to tell a story of unrequited love, in an attempt to demystify the Queer, disorient the Orient and demythify the Southern Gothic and the American Grotesque.
